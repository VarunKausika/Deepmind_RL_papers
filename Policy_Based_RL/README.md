Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning (Policy-Based RL) is an approach within reinforcement learning (RL) where the primary focus is on learning and optimizing a policy directly, rather than estimating value functions (as in value-based methods). In policy-based RL, the agent learns a parameterized policy that maps states to actions, and the objective is to find the best set of policy parameters that maximize the expected cumulative reward.
