Imitation learning, also known as behavioral cloning, is a machine learning technique where an agent learns to perform a task by observing and mimicking the behavior of an expert or a demonstrator. It is a supervised learning approach commonly used in scenarios where it's challenging to define a reward function for reinforcement learning or when human expertise is readily available. Imitation learning has various applications, including autonomous driving, robot control, game playing, and more.
