Exploration strategies are a fundamental aspect of reinforcement learning (RL) and refer to the methods and techniques that an RL agent uses to gather information about the environment in order to learn an optimal policy. In RL, exploration is essential because it allows the agent to discover new states, actions, and transitions, which are crucial for improving its policy and maximizing cumulative rewards.
