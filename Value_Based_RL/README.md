Value-Based Reinforcement Learning (Value-Based RL) is an approach to solving reinforcement learning problems by estimating and optimizing value functions. In Value-Based RL, the primary objective is to find the optimal policy indirectly by estimating the value of different states or state-action pairs. Value functions provide a measure of how good it is to be in a particular state or to take a particular action, and the agent's policy is then derived from these value estimates.
