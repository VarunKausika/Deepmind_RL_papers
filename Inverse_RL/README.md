Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a subfield of reinforcement learning (RL) that focuses on inferring an underlying reward function from observed behavior or demonstrations of an agent, rather than learning the reward function directly. In traditional RL, the agent's goal is to learn a policy that maximizes a predefined reward function. In IRL, the objective is reversed: given the agent's behavior, the aim is to recover the reward function that would best explain or justify that behavior. IRL has various practical applications, particularly in areas where it's difficult to design explicit reward functions or where human demonstrations can provide valuable guidance.
