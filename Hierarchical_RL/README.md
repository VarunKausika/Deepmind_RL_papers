Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is an approach in reinforcement learning (RL) that aims to improve the efficiency and scalability of RL algorithms by introducing a hierarchical structure to the decision-making process. HRL divides complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks or options, allowing agents to learn at multiple levels of abstraction. This approach can make it easier for agents to explore and learn in complex environments and solve problems with long time horizons.
