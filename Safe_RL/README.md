Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) is a subfield of reinforcement learning (RL) that focuses on developing RL algorithms and techniques that ensure that agents operate safely and avoid causing harm to themselves, the environment, or other agents. Safe RL is particularly important in applications where failure can lead to serious consequences, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, healthcare, and industrial control systems.
