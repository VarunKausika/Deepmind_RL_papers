Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a subfield of reinforcement learning (RL) that deals with scenarios where multiple agents interact in a shared environment, and each agent's actions affect not only its own rewards but also the rewards of other agents. MARL is particularly relevant in situations where agents need to collaborate, compete, or coordinate their actions to achieve a common goal or to adapt to a dynamic environment.
