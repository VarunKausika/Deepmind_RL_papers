Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (Model-Based RL) is an approach to reinforcement learning (RL) where the agent learns an explicit model of the environment's dynamics, which it then uses for planning and decision-making. In model-based RL, the agent simulates the environment based on its learned model to explore and learn before applying the acquired knowledge to the real world. This approach offers several advantages, including improved sample efficiency and the ability to make better long-term decisions.
