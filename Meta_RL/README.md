Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) is an advanced subfield of reinforcement learning (RL) that focuses on the problem of learning to learn. In traditional RL, agents learn to perform a specific task through trial and error. In contrast, Meta-RL explores how an agent can acquire the ability to quickly adapt and learn new tasks with minimal experience. It addresses the challenges of generalization, transfer learning, and adaptation in dynamic and unfamiliar environments.
